## Description

This project was created for users who want to know the current weather for a specific city as well as the five day forecast for that city. The site utilizes three APIs provided by OpenWeather to locate the searched city's longitude and latitude, current weather, and future forecasts.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Navigate to https://dgomie.github.io/weather-dashboard/. 

In the search for a city text box, enter the name of the city you wish to find the weather for. An alert with pop up if the city cannot be located by the name. Once a valid city has been entered, the current weather data (including conditions,temperature, wind, and humidity) will display in the main area of the page. Below the current weather, five blue boxes will display the future weather conditions for the next 5 days. The temps displayed in the 5-day forecast are the anticipated high temps for that specific day.

After every successful city search, a grey button with that city's name will appear below the search area. Clicking this button will redisplay that city's weather data in the main area of the site. The city buttons are based on localStorage values and will save up to 10 cities at a time. Once more than 10 cities have been saved, the oldest searched city will be removed, and the rest of the cities will cascade in its place.
